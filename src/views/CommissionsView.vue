      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>While most of my projects are just things I do for fun, I'm open to working on something for you! Want a website? Need a song for something? Let me know!</p>
      
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>If you're looking to commission me, DM or <a target="_blank" href="mailto:zephyr.snow@pm.me">email</a> me! I pay attention to Discord (Join <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/AmqvmdMYWE">my server</a> or message Zephyr#9876) the most.</p>

      <h1>Websites</h1>
      <p><b>Because I am mainly a hobbyist, there's a chance I'll gladly work on a project for you just for fun. I enjoy making websites a lot, and would love to make something for you!</b></p>
      <p>I'll gladly make you a website! I love working on projects with specific aesthetics or interesting visual concepts especially. Depending on what you want, I'll either give you completed HTML, CSS, and JS files for you to do what you want with, or I'll set up a domain name, hosting, and SSL certificate for you!</p>
      <p>Even if I'm not hosting your website, I'll gladly help you set it up wherever you want it!</p>

      <br /><br />

      <h2>Building</h2>
      <p>Depending on what you're looking for, the building process can take a while! I'll keep in touch with you the entire time and keep you updated on what I'm working on.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Prices</h3>
      <p>Prices can vary, depending on how many pages are on the website, the complexity of the design, and how long it takes. A good general estimate is $50-$100 for a simple website, or $200-$600 for a more complex one.</p>
      <p>Usually, I prefer full payment up-front, but I'm willing to take half beforehand and half once it's finished if you prefer.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>Refunds</h3>
      <p>If, for whatever reason, you aren't satisfied, that's okay! If you let me know before I've given you the end product, I'll be happy issue 75-90% refund. I keep 10-25% (depending on complexity & time) for the time I spent working on the project.</p>
      <p><b>If I've already given you the completed website files, I won't give you a refund.</b> During the development process, I'll send you previews for you to review, so if you want a refund, let me know before I send you anything finished.</p>

      <br /><br />

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>If you want, I'll set up a domain name for you, as well as actual hosting for the website. This is a monthly charge, and I will set up a contract. This is usually ~$10/month.</p>

      <br />

      <h3>SSL.Certificates</h3>
      <p>An SSL certificate is a certificate for your website that lets people know it's verified and secure. It's the difference between http:// and https:// at the beginning of the URL, and having one makes your website more trustworthy. I'll purchase & set one up for you if I'm hosting your website for an extra ~$3/month</p>

      <br /><br />

      <h2>Maintenance</h2>
      <p>If you ever need anything changed, just let me know! Depending on the size of the change, I may charge you, but if you're paying me for hosting, it's already covered!</p>

      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p>I really only do music production as a hobby, but if you like what I make and want me to work on something for you, I'd love to give it a shot! I can't really give any concrete prices here, and knowing me, I'm probably down to work on something just for fun. Just shoot me a DM!</p>
